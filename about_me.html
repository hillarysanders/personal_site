            Hey all. Iâ€™m a machine learning researcher and engineer.
            <br><br>

            <!-- I mostly code in Python & bash, but I also work with R, HTML / CSS, and Javascript.
            I'm into neural networks, statistics, and data visualization. -->


            <!-- <h5> Why I love statistics: </h5>
            Statistics is answer to wanting to optimally evaluate evidence and new information about the world.
            <br><br> -->

            There are many questions, unknowns, and beliefs out there in the world. Each person has their own beliefs,
            and these are the output of a unique function that is constantly updating:
            experience comes in, the brain filters the information, and acts, updating itself in the process. Millions of years of
            natural selection has given us incredible brains, capable of processing massive amounts of information.
            Of course, our brains evolved to mesa-optimize things that helped us survive and reproduce back in the day, 
            not neccessarily accurately analyze certain types of information. So when it comes to processing and analyzing, say,
            thousands of numbers on a page, people are both overwhelmed and often fall prey to biases.
            <br><br>
            
            I see statistics as a search for the optimal way to evaluate evidence about the world. The optimal way do estimate what to believe and how confident to be.
            This isn't to say that the data you're looking at won't be biased, but statistics gives you the tools to better analyze any data you're dealing with with.
            As we know, the more advanced our machine learning techniques get (namely deep neural networks trained on billions of human-generated samples), the more stunningly
            accurate these models get, but also the more opaque and often biased they become.

            Humans have been wildy successful as a species. We use tools, we're creative, but crucially: we're incredibly social, cooperative, 
            and we have the ability to communicate complex ideas to each other. Because of this, we've been able to build knowledge and skills very, 
            very quickly.

            Very recently, we've started building machines that are far more capable at performing tasks we find useful.
            That's amazing! The potential for good is incredible. Enter the era of Star Trek?! It's also a bit dangerous.
            In the short term: economic instability amongst growth, expansion of impersonation,
            malware, fake news, and spam. In the medium term: mass unemployment, automated war machines, and the generation of new bioweapons.
            In the long term: the potential of AI agents with goals other than those that we want disempowering or destroying humanity.
            
            I love humans. We're great. I also care about people who haven't been born yet - those who could have been. (Note: I'm very pro-choice,
            and I don't think these two viewpoints need to conflict whatsoever if you have a low dicount rate).
            I think it's unfair to use high discount rates on human life, and the potential for humanity is so vast, that I think it's worth putting
            in a lot of effort to minimize any existential risks that we can.

            For some people, this means working in very important areas dealing with climate change and nuclear war. For me, as someone who 
            loves statistics and has been working in machine learning for over a decade, this means working in AI Safety.
            I'm particularly interested in mechanistic interpretability, gated network architectures, and thinking about how to apply common
            microeconomic concepts to encourage AI agents to act in ways that are beneficial to us in the medium term.

            <!-- <h5>Data visualization:</h5>
            Graphs can show so much!
            <br><br>
            Node and line sizes, colors, shapes, and placements (over time!) can all tell the stories of distinct variables.
            It's pretty hard to see trends that live in these multiple dimensions while staring at spreadsheets. So - especially when you can't understand the data you're working with in one gulp - don't just stare at spreadsheets: make pictures, too!
            Info-graphics are great. (Why do our government's fiscal budgets contain only text?! Hundreds of pages of pure pdf text is painful to digest - I've tried). Anyways.
            <br><br> -->

            <h5>More about me</h5>
            In my spare time, I enjoy making art, adventuring, woodworking, playing board games, and listening to audiobooks.
