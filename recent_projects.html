                        From 2011  to 2012 I worked with the fantastic Mark Huberty, a graduate student in Political Science at the Travers Department at UC Berkeley (who is awesome and basically is the reason I got interested in doing what I'm now happily doing with my life. Props.) I helped develop an original R package to map the evolution of legislation from its introduction as a bill, through the amendment process, until finalization. There are five core pieces of functionality in the Leghist package: 
                        1. Mapping of amendments to their locations in legislative bills. </br>
                        2. Identification of discarded material. </br>
                        3. Mapping of sections between editions of bills.</br>
                        4. Modeling of the content of added and discarded material.</br>
                        5. Visualization of the flow of bill content, by subject matter.
                            
                         Although I was somewhat involved in all parts of the above, I wrote the code for 5). There were two master functions that I created for the package. Both took raw output from 1:4), and created customizable, yet automated, directed ayclic graphs, implemented through the R package igraph. I also wrote automated scripts to test these functions' functionality.
                        
                        
                        I also worked on figuring out how to document (by implementing Roxygen2), test, and finally create the R package in an automated fashion.

                        </h5>
                         This was actually for a school project. I worked with a good group of kids, and we all took our own chunks of the intended project and just sort of ran with it. My goal was to completely automate, and make easily adjustable, the automated pulling of World Bank data, and do the same for some really awesome looking, and informative (!) graphs. I would show you the pretty pictures, but I left my laptop out in the rain, so...

                         <a href="pics/twitter_paper/midterm.pdf" title="Fun With Twitter!"> <font color="000000"> This was one of those class projects that was just way too much fun. I wrote a paper describing this project, which this text links to. Basically, I created a forecasting model which predicts state-level vote-share probabilities by using a hierarchical Bayesian model to incorporate the simple text analysis of state-specific tweets into predictions. The model used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to develop the final posterior distribution. Model priors were based off of state-level 2004 and 2008 vote-share data. Data consisted of recent tweets mentioning 'Obama' or 'Romney'. Although the simple text analysis of tweets is not a perfect substitute for polling data (problems will be discussed below), it offers a potential way to bolster political forecasting models. </font> </a>

                        players' success by the players' past stats. We implemented a plethora of different machine learning methods; I wrote a random forest
                        learner from scratch. Why? Because. It was pretty fun. Code can be found

                         This project broadcasted live, out-of-sample congressional elections predictions based on Mark Huberty's SuperLearner-based algorithm
                        which takes tweets as input. I helped Mark (who is awesome and taught me nearly everything) by cleaning up code, writing a bit myself,
                        and gathering congressional candidate data.

                        <h5>SLA Schema + SLA Ingest and Evaluation Pipelines</h5>
                        The way our company made money was to sign contracts with SLAs (Service Language Agreements) basically saying that we would "gather X data, with Y requirements, and Z restrictions",
                        and then fulfill those contracts by paying contributors money to capture that data. An example contract might require that we capture 30 price observations per month (with price SD < .2), and at least five per week
                        for two brands each for twenty specific consumer products, and all of this for each of seven different regions, with at least 9000 observations per month.
                        <br><br>
                        This information, while human readable, was not machine readable. So things like progress dashboards had to be written specifically for each new contract, instead of spun up automatically.
                        This wasn't scalable, so I designed a 'SLA' schema that could describe a broad range of SLAs requirements via a JSON blob.
                        <br><br>
                        After I translated all current contracts to this machine-readable format and augmented an existing system to push this data (in google-docs, editable by certain employees) to a redshift db.
                        Then, I wrote a pipeline to track SLAs against their contract's data (ran daily). The pipeline tracked % SLA coverage, as well as budgeting overages, across all facets listed in the SLA
                        (e.g. product X brand X month X region, product X brand X week, product X month, product, etc...)

                        I developed a method of clustering these observations to back out 'true' places, and confidence metrics regarding each clustered place's location, name, and actual existence.
                        This was used to help better direct our users when capturing further observations (place based tasks), and used to create better price indices.
